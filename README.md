# WGUPS Routing Program

## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of the WGUPS Routing Program, developed as part of the Western Governors University (WGU) curriculum. The project involves solving a real-world programming problem by applying algorithms and data structures to optimize delivery routes for the WGU Parcel Service (WGUPS).

## Project Overview

The WGUPS Routing Program aims to determine an efficient route and delivery distribution for daily local deliveries (DLD) in Salt Lake City. The goal is to ensure that all packages are delivered on time while meeting specific delivery criteria and keeping the total distance traveled by all trucks under 140 miles.

### Key Features:
- **Efficient Routing Algorithm**: Determines the route for three trucks to deliver packages using the Nearest Neighbor algorithm while satisfying specific delivery constraints.
- **Delivery Constraint Handling**: Ensures all package-specific criteria are met, such as delivery deadlines.
- **Distance Optimization**: Keeps the total distance traveled by all trucks under 140 miles.
- **Real-time Tracking**: Allows the supervisor to track the progress of each truck and its packages based on multiple variables.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Data structures and algorithms knowledge

## Project Structure

- `./`: Contains the main Python scripts implementing the routing algorithm.
- `./CSV`: Includes the data files containing addresses, distances, and the package information.


## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/wgups-routing-program.git
   cd wgups-routing-program
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Program:**
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```
   
## Usage

After running the program, the supervisor can view the progress of each truck and its packages through the console or a generated report.
